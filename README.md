# Shannon-Fano-Algorithm

Shannon Fano Algorithm is an entropy encoding technique for lossless data compression of multimedia.

## Usage
- Run the Compress class
  - if you type yes the file path should be like this (\Users\\[user]\Desktop\\[fileName].txt)
  - use the bites that correspond with the language your text is written with (8 for english, 16 for arabic...)
  - you will get 2 additional files dict.txt (containts the dictionary to decode) and compressed.txt (contains the compressed version of your original text) in your base folder

- Run the Decompress class
  - you should run this class after you run the compress class, or after you put dict.txt and compressed.txt in your base folder

- this is the result
